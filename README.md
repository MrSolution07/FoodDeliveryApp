## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Node.js & npm/yarn**
   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - It's recommended to use `yarn` as the package manager. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install --global yarn
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use `npm`, which comes with Node.js.

2. **Expo CLI**
   - This project is built with Expo, so you need to install the Expo CLI globally:
     ```bash
     npm install --global expo-cli
     ```
   - Make sure you have an Expo account, which you can create at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

3. **Git**
   - Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

4. **Mobile Device or Emulator**
   - You can run the project on a physical device (iOS or Android) using the Expo Go app, which is available on the App Store and Google Play.
   - Alternatively, you can use an emulator. For iOS, you need Xcode installed (macOS only). For Android, Android Studio with an emulator set up is required.
